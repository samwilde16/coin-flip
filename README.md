# Coin Flip website.

In order to test my github and JS proficiency and efficiency, I timed myself to see how quickly I could do the following. 

- Create a repository
- Clone the repository locally
- Set up a css, js and html file
- Create a webpage which simply allows you to flip a coin with a random response 
- Commit and push the project to github 

Overall this took me around 5 minutes to do. I am happy with this efficiency, especially how clean the code is.
